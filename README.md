The aim of this project is to develop a more granular understanding of 
- its customer base 
- predict customersâ€™ response to its marketing campaign 
- establish a target customer profile for future marketing plans 

By analysing customer features, such as demographics and transaction history, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviours and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits. The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers. 

This will not only allow the bank to secure deposits more effectively but also increase customer satisfaction by reducing undesirable advertisements for certain customers.
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution . 
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit .
